# Project Title: Deep Learning Computer Vision Model

## Overview
Briefly introduce the purpose and functionality of your computer vision model. Explain what problem it solves or what improvements it offers over existing solutions.

## Features
List the key features of the model, such as:
- Real-time object detection
- High accuracy on various datasets
- Efficient processing with GPU acceleration
- Support for multiple image formats

## Model Architecture
Describe the architecture of the model, including any important layers, training techniques, and why certain choices were made. Include a diagram if possible.

## Installation

Provide step-by-step instructions to set up the environment and install necessary dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourgithubusername/your-repository-name.git
cd your-repository-name
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

Explain how to use the model after installation. Include basic commands or scripts to run the model:

```bash
python run_model.py --input image.jpg
```

## Dataset

Describe the dataset used for training and testing the model. Include sources if it's publicly available or instructions on how to format the data if users want to train the model with their own data.

## Training

Provide instructions on how to train the model, including any specific hardware requirements:

```bash
python train.py --dataset /path/to/dataset
```

## Evaluation

Explain how to evaluate the model's performance:

```bash
